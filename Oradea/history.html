            Oradea is one of the oldest and most culturally rich cities in Romania.
            Located in the northwest of the country, the city has been shaped by
            centuries of political, religious, and architectural influences.
        </p>
        <p>
            From its medieval fortress to its elegant Art Nouveau buildings,
            Oradea reflects a unique blend of Central European and Romanian history.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- EARLY HISTORY -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Early Beginnings</h2>
        <p>
            Archaeological discoveries show that the area around Oradea has been
            inhabited since ancient times. The city gained importance during the
            Middle Ages due to its strategic position near important trade routes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The construction of the Oradea Fortress marked the beginning of the
            city’s development as a military and religious center.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- MEDIEVAL PERIOD -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Medieval Oradea</h2>
        <p>
            During the medieval period, Oradea became an important cultural and
            religious center. The fortress served both defensive and administrative
            purposes and attracted craftsmen, merchants, and scholars.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city was also known for its religious diversity, hosting Catholic,
            Orthodox, and later Protestant communities.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN ERA -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="mb-3">Austro-Hungarian Influence</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most defining periods in Oradea’s history was the
            Austro-Hungarian era. During this time, the city experienced rapid
            economic growth and urban development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the iconic Art Nouveau buildings in the city center were
            constructed in this period, giving Oradea its distinctive architectural
            identity.

    <section class="section">
        <h2 class="mb-3">20th Century and Modern Era</h2>
        <p>
            The 20th century brought significant political changes, including
            world wars and shifts in borders. Despite these challenges, Oradea
            continued to evolve and adapt.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent decades, extensive restoration projects have revitalized
